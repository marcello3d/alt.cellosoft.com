<h1>The Alt Cloud</h1>

<h2>Introduction<br></h2>
<p>The Alt Cloud is designed to let Alt scale and handle increasing demand by increasing the number of servers running
Alt.</p>
<h2>Peer-to-Peer</h2>
<p>Each Alt server node runs the exact same Alt platform application without the need for configuration.</p>
<p>The node generates a private and public key for identifying and encrypting communication between Alt nodes.  Using 
the Alt control panel, you inform any Alt node of another Alt node's public key and they will become partnered.</p> 
<p>Once two nodes are partnered they can communicate with any other Alt servers they are aware of.</p>
<p>Network connectivity, execution speed/memory is discovered and mapped between the network.  When direct/secure pipes
exist, the servers communicate with standard unencrypted streams, otherwise a ssh tunnel is used.</p>
<h3>Database sharding</h3>
<p>From there, database and execution is partitioned and duplicated between servers.</p>
<p>Since the app code and configuration is stored in the database, this gets duplicated across the network as well.</p>
<h2>Yay big happy family.</h2>
<p>Not sure if this is easy, but it's a fun idea.</p>

<p>That's it for now. </p>
